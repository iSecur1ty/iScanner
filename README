This is a modified version of iScanner.
I trie to make it more flexible, more orgenised, supports sqlite3, with one interface (starting console and web UI from the same file),
and perhaps I'll add other features ... 

---
To install this software you can do :

python setup.py install [path]

if the software already exists in the given path, 
it will ask you to continue if you accept, then  the directory will be removed before installing the new version.
you don't need an admin account to install this software, except when your OS doesn't contain a needed package or module.

---

before starting the program, you can use :

python iscanner.py -h 

I don't like the idea of storing mysql's password in config file, so in this version you must put your password each time you run it with mysql.
